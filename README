This program implements the upwind method for solving 
the kinematic wave equation on a drain direction map. 
We have generated the drain direction map using backward 
propagation.

We used the matplotlibcpp header file and have included it 
in the external folder for convenience. See also the 
following link:

We have written this code for an internship and included 
the final report. See the documents folder.
