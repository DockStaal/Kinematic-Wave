This program implements the upwind method for solving the kinematic
wave equation on a drain direction map. The drain direction map has 
been created using backwards propegation.



This program makes use of the matplotlibcpp header file

https://github.com/Cryoris/matplotlib-cpp

and has been added to the external folder for convenience.
